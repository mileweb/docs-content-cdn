| **Fields**        | **Description**   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Client Region     | Select a region that defines this client zone. We currently support country-level granularity.|
| Client ISP        | Select one or more ISPs that define this client zone. |
| Action Type       | Select the type of action to be performed to requests from this client zone. <br><ul><li><strong>Deliver</strong> = contents will be served by CDN Pro servers to fulfill the requests from this client zone. Only one delivery action is allowed for each client zone. You need to select the server groups to deliver the contents. </li><li><strong>Redirect</strong> = redirect client requests to another destination specified in the Redirect Target field (see below). This can be your origin site or maybe another CDN provider. There can be multiple redirect actions for each client zone.</li><li><strong>Reject</strong> = client requests will always receive a response with a 403 - forbidden error message. Only one reject action is allowed for each client zone.</li></ul>  
| Server Group      | If <strong>Action Type</strong> is set to <strong>Deliver</strong>, select one or more server groups to handle the traffic for this edge hostname. CDN Pro servers are organized into 5 groups based on the traffic cost from low to high: <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium+</strong>, <strong>Ultra</strong>, and <strong>nearChina</strong>. When you select one group, all the lower groups will be included automatically. <br><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>nearChina</strong> is a special server group that can be enabled for you if you want optimal performance serving Chinese visitors, but your domains lack ICP Beian. To enable this server group, contact the CDNetworks support team.</br>| 
| Enable IPv6      | If <strong>Action Type</strong> is set to <strong>Deliver</strong>, select whether you want to enable IPv6 addressing.|
| Redirect Target   | If <strong>Action Type</strong> is set to <strong>Redirect</strong>, specify an IP address or hostname to which CDN Pro will redirect your traffic. |
| Weight | When a client zone has multiple rules defined, each of them will be used randomly with a probability proportional to the weight specified here. |

It will not resolve to any server IP address in mainland China. Only server IP addresses outside China will be returned.
