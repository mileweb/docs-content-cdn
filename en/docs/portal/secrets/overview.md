# Overview of Secrets

Typically, a secret is a password that you share with {{title}} in order for the CDN configuration to work. For example, a secret could be a key used to authenticate client requests to your origin server. By creating a secret and referring to it in your Edge Logic using the secret's name via the syntax `$SECRET(secretName)` the key itself would not be exposed when viewing a property through the CDN Pro portal or fetching it using the CDN Pro API.

## Secrets Page 

Secrets are managed from the Secrets page. To display this page, click **Edge Configurations** in the left pane, and then select **Secrets**.
