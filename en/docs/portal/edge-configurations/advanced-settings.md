| ----------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------|
| Cache Key Hostname      | Enter the hostname to use in the cache key. By default, the incoming Host Header value is used. The cache key is the index to the content stored in the server cache.|
| Has ICP Beian           | Specify whether all hostnames in this property have [Beian in China](</docs/edge-logic/faq.md#china-delivery-and-beian>). <ul><li>If **No** is selected, the CDN Pro proxy servers located in mainland China will not serve this property in order to abide with the laws in China. All visitors will be served by servers outside China.</ul></li> <ul><li>If **Yes** is selected, the CDN Pro API server confirms the Beian status of all hostnames. Once confirmed, visitors in mainland China will be served by the CDN Pro servers in mainland China. If you have ICP Beian, please contact {{title}} to enable the option to deploy to China-based servers.|</ul></li>
| Load Balancer Logic           | Enter Edge Logic to customize load balancing. You can use a subset of the directives, including `if`, `set`, `return`, `eval_func`, `add_header`, `client_max_body_size`, `deny`, and `allow`. For the list of directives allowed in this field, refer to the `baseLbDirectives` and `advancedLbDirectives` fields in the response to the  [system configuration API](</apidocs#operation/get-cdn-systemConfigs>). This list can include advanced Edge Logic directives that have not been enabled for your account. Example:  `if ($http_user_agent = bot) { return 403;}` Note that if the Edge Logic code is extremely long, check the <b>Soft Wrap Text</b> check box to display long text on multiple lines instead of one long line.|</ul></li>
| Certificate Renew Automation | By default, CDN Pro takes control of the contents under the ``/.well-known/{acme-challenge, pki-validation}`` directories to support [certificate auto-renew](</docs/portal/certificates/auto-renewal.md>) for properties. If you need to manage these two directories by yourself on the origin (for example, to implement your own certificate auto-renew mechanism), you can use this configuration option to disable the default behavior. <ul><li>If **Support** is selected, CDN Pro takes control of the two "special" directories to support auto-renewing of the property's certificate. This is the default setting.</ul></li> <ul><li>If **Disable** is selected, CDN Pro releases control of these special directories to the origin.|</ul>
| HTTP/2 | Use the buttons to enable or disable the HTTP/2 protocol. If you disable HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1 is used.<br></ul>
| Video Seeking | The **Video Seeking** fields support using a video player with the selected property. <ul><li>In the **Start Parameter** field, enter the beginning position of a video segment. </ul></li><ul><li>In the **End Parameter** field, enter the ending position of the video segment, or leave this field empty to play the video to the end.</ul></li>
