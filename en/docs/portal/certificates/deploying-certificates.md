# Deploying and Undeploying Certificates

After you create or update a certificate, you must deploy it to either the staging or production environment before it can be used by any properties. If a certificate is no longer used by any property in those environments, you should undeploy it. Undeploying a certificate is also a prerequisite if you want to delete a certificate from the CDN Pro platform.

**Note**: To deploy a certificate to, or undeploy a certificate from, the staging or production environment, you must be the owner of the certificate.

## Deploying a Certificate

1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**. 
2. On the Certificates page, click the name of the certificate you want to deploy.
3. Next to the **Version** field, click the **Deploy** button.
4. When the Deployment Target dialog box appears, select **Staging** or **Production**, and then click the **Deploy Now** button. When the confirmation pop-up appears, click **OK**. <br><br><u><p>OR</br></br></u></li>To deploy the certificate at a later time, click the **Add to Standby task** button in the confirmation pop-up to move this action to the [standby queue](<docs/../../tasks/standby-tasks.md>).<br><br><li>If you clicked **Deploy Now**, it will take about 5 minutes to complete the deployment process. You can watch the progress and wait for it to finish, click the **Go to Dashboard** button in the pop-up to go to the Dashboard, or close the pop-up to perform other tasks while deployment continues in the background. You can always click **Tasks** in the left pane to check the status of the deployment.</br></br></li>
