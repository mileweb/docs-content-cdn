# Deploying and Undeploying Certificates

After you create or update a certificate, you must deploy it to either the staging or production environment before it can be used by any properties. If a certificate is no longer used by any property in those environments, you should undeploy it. Undeploying a certificate is also a prerequisite if you want to delete a certificate from the CDN Pro platform.

**Note**: To deploy a certificate to, or undeploy a certificate from, the staging or production environment, you must be the owner of the certificate.

## Deploying a Certificate

1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**. 
2. On the Certificates page, click the name of the certificate you want to deploy.
3. Click the <strong>Deploy</strong> button and select <strong>Staging</strong> or <strong>Production</strong>.<br>

<strong>Note:</strong> To view the deployment history of the property before deploying it, click the <strong>Deploy</strong> button followed by <strong>History</strong>.</br></br>

4. To deploy the certificate now, click <strong>Deploy Now</strong>. To deploy it at a later time, click <strong>Add to Standby task</strong> to add this task to the [standby queue](</docs/portal/tasks/standby-tasks.md>). If you clicked **Deploy Now**, it will take about 5 minutes to complete the deployment process. You can watch the progress and wait for it to finish, click the **Go to Dashboard** button in the pop-up to go to the Dashboard, or close the pop-up to perform other tasks while deployment continues in the background. You can always click **Tasks** in the left pane to check the status of the deployment.</br></br></li>
