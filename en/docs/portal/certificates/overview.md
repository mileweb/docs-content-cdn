# Overview of Certificates

A digital certificate allows your website to exchange data securely over the Internet using the public key infrastructure (PKI). The certificate enables encryption of the communications between a website and its visitors. CDN Pro supports regular, subject alternative names (SAN), and wildcard certificates. CDN Pro also supports RSA and ECDSA public key algorithms. You can upload your existing certificate, generate self-signed certificates, and use Let's Encrypt to renew expiring certificates automatically.

## Certificates Page 

Certificates are managed from the Certificates page. To display this page, click **Certificates** in the left pane. All certificates are versioned in CDN Pro. After a version is saved, it cannot be changed. If you need to update an expiring certificate, you just create a new version and deploy it to replace the old one. At any time, only one version of each certificate can be deployed into the staging or production environment. 

The **Ownership** field on the Certificates page shows whether a certificate was created by you or shared by a CDN Pro reseller.

- **Me** appears if your customer account created the certificate.
- **Parent** appears if a CDN Pro reseller shared the certificate with you.

The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.
