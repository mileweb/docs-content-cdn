# Using Properties to Configure the Edge

A "property" is a configuration of one or more hostnames (domains) that need to be deployed to the CDN360 edge servers. A property determines how you want the servers to obtain, cache, modify, and distribute your content to end users. The key elements of a property include:
- Service hostname(s) to be accelerated
- One or more origin servers
- Caching rules for different types of contents
- Modifications to the URL or HTTP header fields
- Whether HTTPS is required, TLS certificates, and TLS protocol version

## Managing Properties

On the CDN360 platform, each property is versioned to track the history of changes and allow rollback if needed. Each version can be deployed independently to the staging or production environment. 

Using the Properties page, you can create, modify, validate, and deploy properties. You can also undeploy and delete properties if needed. To display the Properties page, click **Edge Configurations** in the left pane. The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.
