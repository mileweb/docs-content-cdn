# Deploying Your Property

After you create and validate a property version, you are ready to deploy it. Initially, we highly recommend that you always deploy the property to the staging environment to make sure the property is configured properly and behaves as expected. After you confirm that the property is ready to go live, you can deploy it to the production environment.

1. In the left pane, click **Edge Configurations**. 

2. On the Properties page, click the ID of the property you want to deploy.
    <br><u>OR </u></br>
  In the **Actions** column, click the vertical ellipsis for the property you want to deploy, and then select **Edit**. 

3. Scroll down to the **Deployment** section and click either **Staging** or **Production**:<ul><li>To deploy the property now, click **Deploy Now** and proceed to the next step.</ul></li><ul><li>To deploy the property at a later time, click <strong>Add to Standby task</strong> to move this action to the [standby queue](</docs/portal/certificates/standby-tasks.md>).</ul></li> 

**Note:** To view the deployment history of the property before deploying it, click the **Deployment History** button.

4. If you clicked the **Deploy Now** button, click **OK** when the confirmation pop-up appears. Usually, the deployment process finishes in 5 minutes. You can either wait with the progress dialog box, or close it to perform other tasks while the deployment continues in the background. You can click **Tasks** in the left pane to check the status of the deployment at any time.

5. For instructions about testing the property in the staging environment, click [here](</docs/portal/edge-configurations/testing-property.md#testing-property-in-staging>).

# Undeploying a Property

1. In the **Actions** column on the Properties page, click the vertical ellipsis of the deployed property you want to undeploy, and then select **Undeploy from Staging** or **Undeploy from Production**.
