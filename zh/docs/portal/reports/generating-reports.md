# Generating Reports

CDN Pro provides reporting capabilities that allow you to analyze the traffic to your properties, identify trends over time, and pinpoint times when visitors are most likely to land on your site.

Reports are generated from the Reports page. To display this page, click **Reports** > **Charts** in the left pane.

The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.

## Supported Report Types

The following report types are supported:

| **Report**            | **Description**                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traffic Volume        | Reports edge versus origin traffic.                                 |
| Traffic Bandwidth     | Reports edge versus origin traffic bandwidth. Lines represent edge traffic from CDN Pro servers, traffic from your origin servers, and cache hit rate. The vertical (Y) axis shows the bandwidth and hit ratio, while the horizontal (X) axis shows time. The cache hit rate is computed as (edge traffic - origin traffic) / edge traffic.     |
| Requests              | Reports requests made to the files of your property. Lines show the requests to CDN Pro edge servers, requests to your origin servers, and cache hit rate. The cache hit rate is computed as (edge requests - origin requests)/edge requests.              |
| Status Code Details   | Reports the percentage of HTTP status codes returned. For example, code 200 represents a successful request. |
| Origin Status Code Details   | Reports the percentage of HTTP status codes returned in requests to your origin servers. For example, code 200 represents a successful request. |
| Fast Route Traffic Volume   | Reports the traffic to your origin server that use CDNetworks' <a href="/cdn/docs/edge-logic/supported-directives#origin_fast_route">fast route feature</a> to make connections faster and more reliable. |
| Fast Route Requests   | Reports the number of requests to your origin server that uses CDNetworks' <a href="/cdn/docs/edge-logic/supported-directives#origin_fast_route">fast route feature</a> to make connections faster and more reliable. |
| Traffic Volume Summary| Summarizes the edge traffic volume.                               |
| CPU Time| Reports the CPU time consumed in each time interval to serve your properties. You can toggle the unit between **seconds** and **number of cores**. For example, if 3000 seconds of CPU time are reported in a 5-minute interval, it means your properties are maxing out an average of 10 (=3000s/5m) physical CPU cores during that period.                               |
| Edge Hostname Request| Shows the number of requests made to your [edge hostnames](</docs/portal/traffic-management/creating-edge-hostname.md>) over a period of time.                               |
