# Managing Prefetch Requests

CDN Pro supports a prefetch function that warms the CDN Pro cache with new content from your origin server in order to accelerate content delivery to users. When users make requests for the prefetched content, CDN Pro already has the requested content and can serve it immediately without a round trip to the origin. 

Prefetch activities are performed from the following page. To display this page, click **Content Management** > **Prefetch** in the left pane.

The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.
