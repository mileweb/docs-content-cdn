# Managing Origins for Your Property

Origins are your web servers containing the content you want CDN Pro to accelerate. CDN Pro supports more than one origin for each property, along with a number of settings for defining access to your origins.

## Adding, Editing, or Removing Origins in a Property

1. In the left pane, click **Edge Configurations**, and then select **Properties**.
2. From the Properties page, click the ID of the property you want to edit, and then select the version from the **Version Number** drop-down list. 
3. Click the **Edit** button or select **Clone** from the drop-down list to make changes.
4. Edit or remove an existing origin or add a new one:
   - If there is an existing origin (similar to the one in the figure below), you can click the <strong>Edit</strong> link in the <strong>Origins</strong> field and complete the fields in the following dialog box to edit the origin, or click the <strong>Remove</strong> link to remove the origin. 
   - To add a new origin, click the <strong>Add New</strong> link, and then complete the fields in the following dialog box. Required fields are denoted by an asterisk (*).

| **Fields**             | **Description**                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto Detect            | This button appears only when creating a new property. When you click it, CDN Pro tries to resolve the IP address of the hostname you entered for the property. This may or may not be the origin you want to use. Please double-check the results.|
| Origin Name            | A name to identify this origin. The [`origin_pass` directive](</docs/edge-logic/supported-directives.md#origin_pass>) in [Edge Logic](</docs/edge-logic/intro.md>) uses this name to refer to this origin.|
| Servers                | Enter a hostname or IP address and the port numbers of a primary origin server.<p></p><p>Click **Validate** to verify that the server information is correct and reachable.</p><p>To add more servers, click the **Add new +** link. To remove a server, click the **Remove** link.</p><p>If you add more than one server, CDN Pro will distribute origin requests equally among them. To direct more requests to specific servers, enter a percentage value in the **Weight** field. For example, to have 80% of the origin requests directed to "heavy_duty.server.com" and 20% directed to "light_duty.server.com," assign a weight of 4 to "heavy_duty.server.com" and a weight of 1 to "light_duty.server.com."</p>|
| Backup Servers         | Backup origin server that will be used when all primary servers are not accessible. Click **Add new +** to specify the backup server in the same way as primary servers.|
|| **Advanced Settings**                                                         |
| Supported Protocol   | Protocol(s) that your origin server supports. Choices are: <ul><li><strong>HTTP</strong> = use HTTP only.<li><strong>HTTPS</strong> = use HTTPS only.<li><strong>Both</strong> = use HTTP and HTTPS. (*default*)</ul>|
| Verify Origin Certificate        | Specify whether CDN Pro should verify the TLS certificate on the origin servers. Choices are:<ul><li><strong>True</strong> = perform backend verification.<li><strong>False</strong> = do not perform backend verification. (*default*)</ul>|
| Authentication Certificate        |Select a certificate you want to use to authenticate with the origin server. The certificate must be [uploaded](</docs/portal/certificates/creating-certificates.md#uploading-an-existing-certificate>) and then [deployed](</docs/portal/certificates/deploying-certificates.md>) like other certificates.</ul>|
| Host Header           | Enter a `Host` header value that CDN Pro will use to contact the origin. It will also be used as the SNI servername when contacting the HTTPS origin. It should be a valid hostname. You can specify an Nginx variable in this field. A legal variable name begins with a '$' followed by between 3 and 60 lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z). By default, the value of the Host header in the client request will be passed through.|
| Direct Connection     | Specify how the CDN Pro edge servers should reach the origin servers for uncached content or uncacheable requests. Choices are:<ul><li><strong>No Direct</strong> = always go to a parent CDN Pro server. Choose this selection to maximize the cache hit ratio on CDN Pro.<li><strong>Auto</strong> = automatically decide whether to go to the origin directly or to a parent CDN Pro server, based on performance and resource availability. (*default*)<li><strong>Always Direct</strong> = the edge servers should always go directly to the origin servers.</ul>|
| Keep-Alive Timeout     | The concept of HTTP keep-alive is to use a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses rather than open a new connection for every single request/response pair. In this field, enter the maximum number of seconds that a connection can remain open before timing out.|
|Peer Failure Timeout   | Specify the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts to reach one of the origin server's IP addresses or peers before CDN Pro marks it as "unavailable" for a period of time designated by the timeout. If all peers of all servers are unavailable, requests for content from the origin receive an immediate "502 Bad Gateway" HTTP response. By default, six attempts are made to a peer, after which a one-second timeout applies to that peer. If you select <strong>On</strong> the following subfields appear:<ul><li><strong>Failure Threshold</strong> = enter the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts that will be made to reach one of the origin server's IP addresses or peers before CDN Pro marks it as unavailable.</ul></li><ul><li><strong>Timeout</strong> = enter the number of seconds that an origin's server IP addresses or peers will be unavailable.</ul></li>| 
| Peer Selection Algorithm | This setting controls how the origin server is selected when an origin server's hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses. Choices are: <ul><li><strong>Round robin</strong> = Rotate among the peers sequentially. This is the default setting, which tries to evenly distribute the origin traffic to all the peers.  (*default*)<li><strong>Consistent hash</strong> = Distribute the origin traffic based on the hash value of the URL. If the origin server has a cache, this option should help with the hit ratio.<li><strong>Sorted list</strong> = Select the peer based on the network quality. When the origin peers are geographically distributed (such as another CDN), this option should help ensure consistent performance.</ul>|
| Authentication        | Enables authentication for Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 servers. Choices are:<ul><li><strong>None</strong> = no authentication. (*default*) <br><li><strong>AWS S3</strong> = enables authentication for AWS S3 servers. If you select this choice, you need to provide additional information to access the S3 bucket:<ul><li><strong>Region</strong> = select a [region](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions>) from the drop-down list.<li><strong>Access Key</strong> = enter the AWS access key to authenticate with the S3 server.<li><strong>Secret Key</strong> = enter the AWS secret key to authenticate with the S3 server.</ul>|
| Enable Shield        | Enables the shield. The shield is an advanced feature that provides an extra caching layer between the CDN Pro edge servers and origin. The shield reduces the number of servers that can access your origin and improves the cache hit ratio. If your origin server has an IP access control list, call this [API](</zh/cdn/apidocs#operation/get-cdn-shields>) to obtain the current IP addresses of the origin shield, and add the IP addresses of the shield you want to use. You will be notified by email if there are any changes to the IP addresses. If you require this feature, contact the [{{title}} support team](mailto:support@{{siteDomain}}).| 
| Shield               | If you enabled the shield, select a shield location that is the most appropriate location for the origin. To use a shield in China, your property must have ICP Beian and enable **Has ICP Beian** in **Advanced Settings** on the [Property page](</docs/portal/edge-configurations/creating-property.md#advanced-settings>). For more information, contact the [{{title}} support team](mailto:support@{{siteDomain}}). |
