# Checking Deployment and Undeployment Results

When a property and its associated certificates are deployed, CDN Pro sends the configurations to thousands of edge servers around the world, and then checks that the servers loaded the configurations properly. The undeployment procedure goes through a similar process. The time to complete a deployment and undeployment task can take from 2 to 5 minutes. If you close the deployment or undeployment progress dialog box after you start the task, you can return to the task list to check the status.

1. In the left pane, click **Tasks** > **Deployment**.

2. To filter results by time range, click the icon circled in the figure below and specify a start date and end date for your search.

**Note:** You can also use the **Search** box at the top of the Deployment form to filter the results. Filtering is not case-sensitive.

4. To view standby tasks, click the [**Standby Task** button](<docs/../../tasks/standby-tasks.md>) at the top right.
