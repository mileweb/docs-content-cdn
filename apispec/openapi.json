One typical use case is when all requests carry the same URL, but use a particular header to indicate the resources. \n\nThis is an optional field. The default value is an empty string. A valid value is a string meeting the following criteria:\n<ol>\n<li>Consists of alphanumeric characters, underscore _, equal sign =, dollar sign $, and ampersand sign &.</li>\n<li>The variable names can only be in one of the following formats: $http_name, $cookie_name, or $arg_name.</li>\n<li>At least one variable must be specified. No more than three are permitted.</li>\n<li>The total length should be no more than 100 characters.</li>\n</ol>\nThe validator will treat any dollar sign and the string after it (before any = or & or $) as a variable. \n\nHere are some examples of valid values:\n<table>\n<tr><td>$http_abc</td></tr>\n<tr><td>abc=$http_abc&def=$http_def&c_123=$cookie_123</td></tr>\n<tr><td>abc=$http_abc=$http_def</td></tr>\n<tr><td>$http_abc&$http_def</td></tr>\n<tr><td>=$http_abd&</td></tr>\n<tr><td>&&abc==$http_abc&&&===qwer</td></tr>\n</table>\n",

For example, \"^domain\" would match on hostnames domain.com and domain123.com but not abc.123domain.com. \n\nSince a limited number of characters are permitted in URIs, you must encode '^' as '%5E' when specifying a search parameter containing it in the URI, for example, <code>curl -i --url 'https://ngapi.cdnetworks.com/cdn/properties?search=%5Edomain' ... </code>.\n\nNote that a property will be returned if the search matches on any version of the property which has not been deleted.

The value can be preceded by an exclamation mark, '!', to invert the search.  For example: \n<code>\nhasConfig=edgeLogic!sorted</code>. In this case, we check that the <i>edgeLogic</i> field does not include the value 'sorted'. \n\nSearches for values of numeric or boolean fields require an exact match. However, partial matches are supported for string fields. For example, <code>hasConfig=hostnames:domain</code> returns all properties with a hostname containing the string 'domain' such as 'mydomain.com' and 'thedomains.com'. \n\nIf a colon and value are omitted, all properties with a non-empty value for the field will be returned.\n\nSpecify multiple <i>hasConfig</i> parameters to filter on multiple conditions. Example: \n<code>\nhasConfig=hasBeian:true&hasConfig=realTimeLog</code> Only properties matching all the parameters will be returned.\n\nIf a property has multiple versions, the property will be included in the API response if any of its versions matches the <i>hasConfig</i> parameter.\n\nSubfields of a property version can be specified by using the period symbol as a separator. Refer to additional examples below.\n\nIf matching against values with spaces or special characters, remember to encode them in the URL.\n\nAdditional examples:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr><td>hasConfig=disableHttp2:true</td><td>Return properties that don't support HTTP2</td></tr>\n<tr><td>hasConfig=extraServicePorts.http:85</td><td>Return properties supporting port 85 for HTTP requests.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>hasConfig=origins.servers:myorigin.com</td>\n<td>Return properties using myorigin.com as an origin server.</td></tr></table>\n\n"
